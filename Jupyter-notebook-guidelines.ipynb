    " * Notebooks provide an environment to combine rich text (formatting, links, formulas), programming code and the output generated by the code (figures, tables, ...)\n",
    " * Scripts are pure code that allow plain text comments and produce output in separate files or on the terminal\n",
    " * If you are not willing to write rich text explanations for your code, you better start coding a script rather than a notebook.\n",
    "     * It can always be converted later into a notebook\n",
    "     * Easier to develop and test\n",
    "     * Much lighter for the version control system (git)"
