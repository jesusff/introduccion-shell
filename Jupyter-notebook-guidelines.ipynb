    "\n",
    " * If you are not willing to write rich text explanations for your code, you better start coding a script rather than a notebook.\n",
    "     * It can always be converted later into a notebook\n",
    "     * Easier to develop and test\n",
    "     * Much lighter for the version control system (git)\n",
    " * Use hierarquical sectioning (`#`, `##`, `###`, ...) even if you don't like the size of the resulting headers.\n",
    "     * Do not skip section levels\n",
    "     * Choose meaningful section titles\n",
    "     * Take time to think of the titles. There is no rush.\n",
    "     * Do not repeat section titles in the same notebook (anchors are automatically created)\n",
    "     * Do not use section header markers for styling your text. Use **boldface**, _italics_, or `code` markers.\n",
    " * Do not enter comments in the code. Use the notebook rich text features\n",
    "     * You can refer to the `variables` and their meaning in the text"
