We'll work with a text file for *Alice in Wonderland*, which can be downloaded from the Gutenberg Project website at https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt.
Write a bash shell one-liner to:
 
 * Remove the header and footer corresponding to the Gutenberg project
 * Rank the words in the book according to their frequency (remove special characters and ignore case)
 * Save the words that appear more than 50 times in a file `word-count-alice.txt`

Use Moodle's forum to discuss the problems found.
Acknowledge all sources of information used (books, online tutorials, stackexchange threads, etc.) in the Moodle comments to the assignment.
